# 👋 Hi, I'm Joshua — Junior Web Developer

I’m a Junior Web Developer who loves the whole idea of *creating things* and solving problems. I’m big on noticing the small nuances—whether it’s behaviour in a UI, logic in a feature, or the way different parts of an app connect. Full-stack problem solving is where I feel most at home, and I enjoy taking ideas from nothing and turning them into something real, useful, and well structured.

My approach mixes creativity, logic, and attention to detail. My faith is also a big part of who I am — it keeps me grounded, intentional, and focused on building things that genuinely help people.
